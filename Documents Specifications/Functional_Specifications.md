## 1. Introduction 

### 1.1 Purpose 

<img src="img/harfang3d-logo.png" width="100" height="100">

[HARFANG® 3D](https://www.harfang3d.com/en_US/) is a 3D engine that allows you to create 3D games and applications. It is a cross-platform engine that can be used on Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS, Android, and HTML5. It is written in **C++** and uses OpenGL for rendering. It is also compatible with Vulkan and DirectX 11.

Based on the information provided, it appears that the purpose of developing another 3D engine, **HARFANG® 3D** is to meet the specific technical, sovereignty, and long-term requirements of the civil and defense industries. These industries have strong technical requirements such as safety certification and custom hardware, as well as a need for confidentiality and the ability to run offline.
