# Project 1: Harfang3D Binding

## Description

This project is a binding of the Harfang3D engine in F# to C++. The goal is to be able to use the Harfang3D engine in F#.They already have binding for Python, lua and Go. We will use the C++ binding as a reference.
Harfang3D is a 3D game engine written in C++ and designed for ease of use and extensibility. It is a cross-platform engine that runs on Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS, Android, and the web. It is also a complete game development environment that includes a 3D editor, a visual scripting environment, a 3D asset pipeline, and a 3D game framework.
