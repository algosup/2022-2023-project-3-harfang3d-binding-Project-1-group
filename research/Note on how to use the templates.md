This is an example, adapt it depending on:
- Your needs,
- Your organization.
But:
- write down your resources
- write down what you find

==This should be work notes completed as you go, but at the end of the project, it should also be the basis for documents you could add to a report.==


I provided an example of :
- A starting point template,
- Client research,
- Product research.
These examples can be used, adapted or completely modified.

I want, at the very least, 
- separate notes for:
	- your starting point
	- your client research
	- your product research
	- your software/hardware research
- A clear bibliography (the list of your resources) with
	- why it's a good resource
	- what it contains that is useful to you (subject)
- If you can cross-reference your resources, even better
- If you can structure your notes in a synthetic manner with personal additions (what ideas it gives you, what understanding you gain, what you need to understand better), even better
