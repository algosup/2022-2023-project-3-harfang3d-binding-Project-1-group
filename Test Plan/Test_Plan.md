# Test Plan

## Introduction

The goal of this document is to provide a clear and concise description of the test strategy for the Harfang3D project. The project involves creating a F# binding for the engine, and testing it against the existing bindings for Python, Lua, and Go.

## Preparation

<<<<<<< HEAD
```md
- Fork the Harfang3D project on GitHub.
- install the required dependencies.
- install a c++ compiler , Cmake and also gcc.
```

## Test Cases

```md
- Test case 1: Test  the existing bindings for Python, Lua, and Go with the test that already created.
- Test case 2: Test to translate something from c++ to F# and see if it works.
- Test case 3: Try to make a small part of the engine in F# and see if it works.
- Test case 3: Test the F# binding for the F# binding that We'll be creating.
```

## Execution

```md
- First step is to succed in building the project.
- Second step is to run the tests that are already existing for the other bindings in Python, Lua, and Go.
- Create the F# binding and write the tests and fix any issues found during testing.
```

## Results

```md
- Test results: Summarize the results of the testing, including any successes, failures, or anomalies.
- Test metrics: Provide any relevant metrics or statistics, such as test coverage or pass/fail rate.
```

## Conclusion

```md
- Summary: Summarize the overall results of the testing phase and the state of the product.
- Recommendations: Provide any recommendations for addressing any issues or problems that were identified during testing.
- Final opinion: Give an overall opinion on the quality of the product and its readiness for release.
