# Test Plan for Harfang3D project

## Overview

The goal of this document is to provide a clear and concise description of the test strategy for the Harfang3D project. The project involves creating a F# binding for the engine, and testing it against the existing bindings for Python, Lua, and Go.

## Test Strategy
- We will use the C++ binding as a reference for the F# binding, and ensure that the F# binding behaves in the same way as the C++ binding. This includes verifying that the F# binding implements all the functionality provided by the C++ binding, and that it behaves in the same way in terms of performance and resource usage.
- We will use the existing test suites for the C++ and Python bindings to test the F# binding. We will run these tests using the F# binding, and verify that the tests pass and the output is the same as when the tests are run using the C++ and Python bindings.
- In addition to the existing test suites, we will create new test cases specifically to test the F# binding. These tests will cover all the functionality provided by the F# binding and validate that it behaves correctly and as expected.
- We will write both unit tests, which test individual functions or classes in isolation, and integration tests, which test the interactions between different components of the system.
- We will use popular test frameworks such as CppUnit, CppUnitLite, googletest/googlemock, and unittest.
- We will measure performance of the F# binding compared to other language binding on a specific test case to make sure it does not add a significant overhead.
- We will test the F# binding on different platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS) and configurations (different CPU architectures, different versions of the F# runtime, etc.).
- We will use code coverage tools to measure the percentage of code that is covered by the tests.
- We will set up a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the execution of the test suite and to make it easy to run the tests on a regular basis.

## Test Deliverables
- Test cases, test scripts, and test results
- Test coverage report
- Test case management tool

## Roles and Responsibilities
- The development team will be responsible for creating the F# binding and writing the tests.
- The test team will be responsible for executing the tests, analyzing the results, and reporting any issues found.
- The development team will be responsible for fixing any issues found during testing.

## Schedule
- The test plan will be finalized at the beginning of the project.
- The testing will take place during the development process, and will be ongoing throughout the project.
- A final testing and regression testing will take place before the release of the project.
