# Test Plan

## Introduction

The goal of this document is to provide a clear and concise description of the test strategy for the Harfang3D project. The project involves creating a F# binding for the engine, and testing it against the existing bindings for Python, Lua, and Go.

## Preparation

- Fork the Harfang3D project on GitHub.
- install the required dependencies.
- install a c++ compiler , Cmake and also gcc.

## Test Cases

- Test case 1: Test the F# binding against the existing bindings for Python, Lua, and Go.
- Test case 2: Test the F# binding for the F# binding that We'll be creating.

## Execution

- First step is to succed in building the project.
- Second step is to run the tests that are already existing for the other bindings in Python, Lua, and Go.
- Create the F# binding and write the tests and fix any issues found during testing.

## Results

- Test results: Summarize the results of the testing, including any successes, failures, or anomalies.
- Test metrics: Provide any relevant metrics or statistics, such as test coverage or pass/fail rate.

## Conclusion

- Summary: Summarize the overall results of the testing phase and the state of the product.
- Recommendations: Provide any recommendations for addressing any issues or problems that were identified during testing.
- Final opinion: Give an overall opinion on the quality of the product and its readiness for release.

## Annexes

- Any other relevant documentation, such as screenshots, log files, or specifications.
