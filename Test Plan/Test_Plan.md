## Test Strategy

The first thing to do is to be able to run the tests that are already existing for the other bindings , The tests  that are already existing for the bindings in Python, Lua, and Go.ALso understand the code that the team received. After that, the tests will be ported to F# and executed against the F# binding.

## Test Deliverables

-Test for the F# binding

## Roles and Responsibilities

- The development team will be responsible for creating the F# binding and writing the tests and fixing any issues found during testing.
- The test team will be responsible for executing the tests, analyzing the results, and reporting any issues found during testing.

## Schedule
